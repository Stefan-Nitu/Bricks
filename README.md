# 🧱 Bricks

**A Scalable Modular Architecture for AI-Driven iOS Development**

---

## 🤔 Why Bricks?

Bricks is a pragmatic and scalable architecture built specifically for iOS teams that want to safely and effectively integrate AI-generated code into real-world projects. It's about structure, separation, and scale.

Just like bricks in architecture, this system is:
- **Modular** — each feature and service is isolated
- **Composable** — modules plug together cleanly via protocols
- **Replaceable** — implementations are swappable, mockable, and AI-friendly
- **Scalable** — perfect for teams of any size

Whether you're a senior architect or mentoring junior devs, Bricks helps you scale your app and your team without codebase chaos.

## 🧩 Project Structure

Bricks emphasizes a clear, layered modular structure:

- **CoreInterfaces** (abstract interfaces and protocols)
- **InfrastructureModules** (implementations of CoreInterfaces, often AI-generated, used across features)
- **FeatureModules** (user-facing features, local coordinators, and views)
- **SharedUtilities** (common, reusable helpers and extensions)
- **App Module** (Composition root, global coordinators, and analytics integration)

```plaintext
📦 Bricks Workspace
├── 📱 YourApp (Composition root, global coordinators, analytics)
├── 📦 CoreInterfaces (Protocols)
├── 📦 InfrastructureModules (Concrete implementations)
├── 📦 FeatureModules (Views, ViewModels, Local Coordinators)
└── 📦 SharedUtilities (Extensions, Helpers)
```

### 🔧 What Are InfrastructureModules?
InfrastructureModules are dedicated to concrete implementations of services that are defined as protocols in `CoreInterfaces`. These modules:

- Perform **external tasks** like networking, persistence, analytics, etc.
- Are often **AI-generated** (e.g., GPT or Cursor implementations for `NetworkClient`, `AuthService`, etc.)
- Are **shared across features**, ensuring reusability and avoiding duplication
- Are completely **decoupled** from UI and feature logic

They are where "how it works" lives, while the rest of the app depends only on the "what it should do" (the interface). This makes your code easier to test, mock, and scale over time.

## 🤖 AI Integration

1. **Define Contracts**: Protocols go in `CoreInterfaces` (e.g., `ProfileService`, `NetworkClient`).
2. **Generate Implementations**: Use tools like Cursor or GPT to build them into `InfrastructureModules`.
3. **Inject & Compose**: Your App Module wires everything together by injecting services into the feature modules.

AI is contained to well-defined, swappable bricks that never bleed into the rest of the structure.

## 🧑‍💻 Who Is Bricks For?

- **Juniors**: Learn safe, well-structured Swift codebases.
- **Mids**: Move faster with AI-assistance, without breaking the architecture.
- **Seniors & Architects**: Enforce clean boundaries and keep the team productive at scale.
