# 🚀 MAICA

**Modular AI iOS Clean Architecture**

---

## 🤔 Why MAICA?

MAICA is a straightforward, scalable architecture designed for iOS projects that harness AI (like Cursor or GPT) to generate code without sacrificing quality or maintainability. Much like MVVM, VIPER, or RIBs, MAICA provides a clean structure, but with AI-driven code generation in mind.

MAICA stands for:
- **M**odular
- **A**I
- **i**OS
- **C**lean
- **A**rchitecture

By combining these core concepts, MAICA ensures your code remains organized, testable, and easy for teams of all levels to navigate—even when integrating AI-generated modules.

## 🧩 Project Structure

MAICA emphasizes a clearly defined modular structure:

- **CoreInterfaces** (abstract interfaces and protocols)
- **Implementation Modules** (AI-generated implementations)
- **Feature Modules** (user-facing features, local coordinators, and views)
- **SharedUtilities** (common, reusable helpers and extensions)
- **App Module** (Composition root, global coordinators, and analytics integration)

```plaintext
📦 MAICA Workspace
├── 📱 YourApp (Composition root, global coordinators, analytics)
├── 📦 CoreInterfaces (Protocols)
├── 📦 ImplementationModules (AI-driven concrete implementations)
├── 📦 FeatureModules (Views, ViewModels, Local Coordinators)
└── 📦 SharedUtilities (Extensions, Helpers)
```

### How It Works
1. **App Module**: Ties everything together; includes big coordinators and global services (like analytics) and orchestrates dependencies.
2. **Feature Modules**: Encapsulate views, local coordinators, and business logic related to a specific feature.
3. **CoreInterfaces**: Houses protocols and abstract definitions for networking, data storage, analytics, etc.
4. **Implementation Modules**: Contain actual code that conforms to the protocols in **CoreInterfaces**—perfect for AI generation.
5. **SharedUtilities**: Shared extensions, helpers, or utility code.

## 🤖 AI Integration

1. **Define Abstractions**: Keep protocols (e.g., `HTTPClient`) in `CoreInterfaces`.
2. **AI-Generated Implementations**: Let AI fill in the implementation modules (e.g., `URLSessionHTTPClient`).
3. **Composition & Injection**: The App Module composes dependencies and injects them into Feature Modules, ensuring a clean separation.

AI can then focus on generating isolated, testable code without cluttering your architecture.

## 🧑‍💻 Intended Audience

- **Junior Developers**: Learn how to build structured iOS apps using a clear, AI-friendly architecture.
- **Intermediate Developers**: Scale up using AI to speed up implementation, while maintaining robust module boundaries.
- **Senior Developers & Architects**: Maintain architectural integrity and help teams adopt modern, AI-driven workflows.
